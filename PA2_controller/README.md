# Overview
The following project will allow the player to control a ship either with a keyboard input or a controller input.  The user will need to dodge the incoming ships and the incoming lasers.  The user will have a specific amount of health and will only loose health if a laser hits the users ship.  If the user is hit by a ship, the user will automatically lose.  The terminal will then display the final score.
